Background:

    Free-throws is an retro-style 2D game based on shooting basketball free-throws. The game will involve user timing/precision to reach the highest score possible. A user will select from the displayed NBA players with their career free-throw percentage. Difficulty to make a free-throw will depend on the player they choose (their career free-throw%) and current score (increasing in difficulty as score increases). The game will have background music/sound effects and visuals from free online sources.


Functionality & MVPs:

In Free-Throws, users will be able to:
- have option to mute and un-mute sound
- utilize timed-input-detection to structure user's shot-attempt
- utilize sprites for animation of player, ball, and net
- have dynamic data on selected NBA players
- event-dependent sound effects for flavor
- navigation links to select player, play game, reset game, and view high scores

<!-- In addition, this project will include:

- An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
- A production README -->
